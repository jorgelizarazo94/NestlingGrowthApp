Overview

The Nestling Growth App is an interactive web application built with Dash, designed to analyze and visualize bird nestling growth data using multiple biological growth models, including:

Logistic

Gompertz

Richards

Von Bertalanffy

Extreme Value Function (EVF)

This app is ideal for ecologists, ornithologists, and conservation biologists looking to model nestling growth patterns, compare model performance using AIC/BIC, and export results seamlessly.

Features

✔ Upload CSV files with growth data.
✔ Select variables dynamically (e.g., weight, wing, tarsus).
✔ Automatically fit multiple growth models and visualize the best fit.
✔ Export graphs and model results in CSV and PNG formats.
✔ Interactive UI powered by Dash and Plotly.
