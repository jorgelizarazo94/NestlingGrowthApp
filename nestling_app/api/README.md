An interactive Dash app to analyze nestling growth using biological models.
  

The Nestling Growth Analyzer is an 
interactive Dash web application designed
for ecologists, ornithologists, and 
conservation biologists. 

It simplifies analyzing and modeling 
the growth of bird nestlings using 
well-known biological growth models, 
including Logistic, Gompertz, Richards, 
Von Bertalanffy, and Extreme Value 
Function (EVF). This intuitive tool 
enables users to quickly evaluate growth 
patterns, compare models based on 
statistical criteria (AIC and BIC), 
and export detailed analysis results.
