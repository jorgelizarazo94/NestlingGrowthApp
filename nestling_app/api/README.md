well-known biological growth models, 
including Logistic, Gompertz, Richards, 
Von Bertalanffy, and Extreme Value 
Function (EVF). This intuitive tool 
enables users to quickly evaluate growth 
patterns, compare models based on 
statistical criteria (AIC and BIC), 
and export detailed analysis results.
